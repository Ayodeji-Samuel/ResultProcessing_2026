## Issue Resolution

### Original Issue Reported:
> "I update a level adviser role to only lecturer. Not only that the role remain as level adviser, it went ahead to change access to full access."

### Fix Applied:
1. **Backend Logic** (auth.py):
   - Added conditional logic to clear program/level when role is 'lecturer'
   - Same logic applied in both create_user and edit_user routes

2. **Frontend Forms**:
   - JavaScript automatically hides/disables program/level fields for lecturer
   - Fields are cleared when role changes to lecturer
   - Visual feedback with field disabling

3. **Database**:
   - Migration ensured all fields exist
   - Schema verified correct

### Test Results:
✅ **Backend Test**: Role update works correctly (see test output above)
✅ **Database Test**: All fields present and functioning
✅ **Logic Test**: Program and level properly cleared for lecturers
